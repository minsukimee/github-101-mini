Git & GitHub One-Page Cheat Sheet
🔹 DAILY WORKFLOW (MOST IMPORTANT)
Start your day
git switch main
git pull


→ Get the latest official code

Start a task
git switch -c feature/my-task


→ One task = one branch

Work & save progress
git status
git add filename        # or git add .
git commit -m "Clear message"


→ One idea = one commit

Backup / share work
git push -u origin feature/my-task   # first push only
git push                             # after

Open Pull Request (on GitHub)

Explain what you did

Let CI run

Fix review comments

Push again (same branch)

Merge (usually squash)

Squash & merge PR

Delete branch on GitHub

Cleanup after merge
git switch main
git pull
git fetch --prune
git branch -d feature/my-task

🔹 BRANCHING RULES

Branch = workspace

Main = protected

One branch per task

Push many times, not many branches

Delete branch after merge

🔹 PUSH COMMANDS (MEMORIZE)
First push of a new branch
git push -u origin branch-name

Every push after
git push

🔹 PULL REQUEST (PR) FLOW

Create branch

Commit locally

Push branch

Open PR

Review comments

Push fixes (same branch)

CI passes

Merge

Delete branch

🔹 MERGE STRATEGIES (WITH ANALOGY)
Merge Commit

Analogy: Stapling all drafts together

Keeps all commits

Adds “merge” commit

Safe but messy history

Squash & Merge ⭐ (RECOMMENDED)

Analogy: Submitting only the final report

All PR commits → 1 commit on main

Clean history

Most common in industry

Rebase & Merge

Analogy: Rewriting drafts as if perfect

Clean & linear

Rewrites history

Advanced teams only

🔹 GITHUB ACTIONS (CI) — SIMPLE MODEL

.yml file = instruction sheet

GitHub = automation robot

Push / PR = trigger

Runner = temporary Linux machine

run: commands decide pass/fail

CI truth:

If any command fails → CI fails

🔹 SAFE UNDO / RECOVERY (NO PANIC)
Undo file changes
git restore filename

Unstage file
git restore --staged filename

Fix last commit message
git commit --amend

Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

Emergency recovery (black box)
git reflog

🔹 FETCH vs PULL
git fetch        # check updates safely
git pull         # fetch + apply


Use fetch when unsure.

🔹 CLEANUP COMMANDS
git fetch --prune        # remove deleted remote branches
git branch --merged      # see safe-to-delete branches
git branch -d branch     # delete local branch

🔹 GOLDEN RULES (REMEMBER THESE)

One task = one branch

One idea = one commit

PR follows a branch, not a commit

Same branch → many pushes

CI protects main

Squash keeps history clean

If not pushed → always recoverable

🔹 WHAT RECRUITERS LOOK FOR

Clean README

Branch + PR usage

CI checks passing

Squash merges

Clear commit messages

🧠 FINAL MENTAL MODEL

Git = version control
GitHub = collaboration + automation
CI = robot quality checker
